## 1) Python Programming Basics
This codes an echo as if you were shouting into a canyon.\

This is one example output of the echo program.\

## 2) Python Decorator Implementation
This codes a Fibonacci number calculation using recursion (@lru_cache)\

This is a shortened example output with the given number of 100.\

This is a graph of the execution time of this program versus the number of which it is computing. The semi-linear looking line is a good sign this process was done correctly using recursion-as without recursion the graph would take on a more exponential slope as each calculation starts from scratch.\
